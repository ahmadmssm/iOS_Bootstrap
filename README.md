__[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)__ is a dependency manager for iOS Cocoa projects, You can install it with the following command:

```

> CocoaPods 1.1+ is required to build __iOS_Bootstrap__.

$ pod install
```

Once your project is integrated with the __iOS_Bootstrap__ , you can pull updates using the following command:

##How to use :

####__<p style='color:red'>Note :</p>__


Due to a bug in Cocoapods, so the Storyboard sometimes many fail to render if you added a custom ```@IBDesignable``` view to a component in storyboard and this custom ```@IBDesignable``` view was in the pod files path (Any pod not just my pod) and not your project files path, so to solve this problem please add the following code to the end of your pod file.


```ruby
# Workaround for Cocoapods issue #7606
post_install do |installer|
        installer.pods_project.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings.delete('CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED')
        config.build_settings.delete('CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED')
    end
end
```

## FAQs :

1.  <b style='color:red'>__Do i need to install Alamofire ?__</b><br>
No, you do not need to do so since Alamofire will be installed  once you add  the `iOS_Bootstrap` to your project.

2. <b style='color:red'>__Waht if i need to use Alamofire or anyother dependacy from the `iOS_Bootstrap`, What i have to do ?__</b><br>
All you have to do is to import the library to your view comtroller instead of importing `iOS_Bootstrap`.
